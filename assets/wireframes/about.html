			<p><img src="http://placehold.it/250x250" alt="cynthia" class="cynthia"> Many people associate cupcakes with the 1950’s and the '60’s and the cupcakes that “Mom used to make” for school bake sales or fundraisers. However, these cupcakes were made for children in only basic designs and flavours. Today, cupcakes are decidedly different. They are made more for adults than kids and have gone both gourmet and upscale. This is the focus of The Cupcake Lounge, owned and operated by Cynthia Basilio.</p>

<p>Cynthia was born in Mexico where, coincidentally, two of the world's most important baking ingredients -- vanilla and chocolate -- actually originated. She was a natural in the kitchen at a young age. Cynthia later studied art and it's her unique sense of design and flair that's evident in many of her creations today. Who else would think of using ancho, chipotle or mango in a cupcake? And who else can make it taste fabulous? Cynthia started baking cupcakes more than 10 years ago, and is a graduate of the Baking and Pastry Arts Program at George Brown College in Toronto.</p>

<p>As part of the 2012 Latin American Heritage Day in Toronto, Cynthia Rojano was selected as Latin American Entrepreneur of the Year, for her invaluable entrepreneurial contributions to benefit others in the Latin and Canadian communities of National Capital Region and awarded for her efforts by the Mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, on September 8, 2012. <img src="http://placehold.it/650x300&amp;text=Feature+Image" alt="image" class="cyn"> </p>
